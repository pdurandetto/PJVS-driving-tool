# PJVS-driving-tool
Python program capable of properly driving a 13-bit Programmable Josephson Voltage Standard (PJVS) through the remote-control of four 4-channel arbitrary waveform generators and a voltmeter. It is made up by two forms: 1) for checking IV characteristics of each PJVS subsection and 2) for synthesizing stepwise voltage waveforms.
