# PJVS-driving-tool
Python program capable of properly driving a 13-bit Programmable Josephson Voltage Standard (PJVS) through the remote-control of four 4-channel arbitrary waveform generators and a nanovoltmeter. It is made up by three forms: 1) for checking IV characteristics of each PJVS subsection; 2) for testing quantization;  3) for synthesizing stepwise voltage waveforms.
